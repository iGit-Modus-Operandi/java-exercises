* PROBLEM: Given two strings, s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
* Time Complexity: O(s + t), because we're gonna have to iterate through both of the strings
* Memory Complexity: O(s + t), because we are building hashmap that are gonna be potentially up to the size of s and t
